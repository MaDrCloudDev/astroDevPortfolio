# [astroDevPortfolio](https://astrodevportfolio.MaDr.io/)

A modern visual portfolio I built with Astro, Svelte &amp; React components, w/ Tailwind.

This use to be my portfolio before SvelteKit released, when I switched over, and abandoned the long, anchor-page approach. I had built it in Next.js first, but the performance of the final product wasn't great. The Astro version came out much cleaner and faster.

```
npm i
npm run dev
npm run build
```
